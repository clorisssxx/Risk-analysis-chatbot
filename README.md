For the risk control department of a financial company, the types of risks involved can include credit risk, counterparty risk, market risk, and many others. Credit risk is primarily related to changes in the counterparty's creditworthiness, and the risk control department needs to monitor daily changes in credit utilization. Counterparty risk and market risk are mainly associated with margin calls. The risk control department must monitor the positions of counterparties daily, as well as price changes of the commodities they hold in the market, to determine whether margin calls are necessary. Additionally, there are many other risks specific to the company's business operations. A company may have numerous spreadsheets covering various aspects of its business. When someone unfamiliar with the company's operations, such as an intern, needs to find information or locate spreadsheets related to the company's business, they can only ask others or their mentors. Even for those who have been with the company for a long time, some business details can be easily forgotten.  

I have developed a conversational website where employees or this female employee can ask questions if they are unsure how to find information related to the company's business or the location of spreadsheets. They will first receive a brief guidance response, followed by a complete answer. The current company setting is a futures trading company, and the questions involve futures commodity trading, a trader’s trading permissions, the company's credit approval authority, and other related information.  

I first obtained an initial base spreadsheet named "risk insights.xlsx," which contains some sample indexed questions and their corresponding answers. The answers are divided into Answer 1 and Answer 2. Some questions include both Answer 1 and Answer 2, while others only have Answer 1. The answer types include text and tables. For example, when generating a trader's trading permissions, Answer 2 should output the corresponding codes based on the Chinese names of the commodities listed in Answer 1. Please help me translate this passage into English.
